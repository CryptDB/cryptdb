        * require php 4.1 or greater
        * many bug fixes

Version 0.8 (3/11/03):
        * Change config file to use defines rather than variables.
        * You _need_ gettext-0.11.6-pre1 or later to parse with xgettext.  I
          have a copy of this if anyone needs it.  My language support is
          going to lag unless someone helps.  I only speak English, so it's
          not useful to me.
        * Very much updated documentation (thanks Tai)
        * greatly improved install script (thanks to motivation from Tai,
          and ideas from postnuke)
        * admin support, plus a variable to adjust the anonymous permissions
          (Thanks Nate for the first part)
        * cluster calendars. one base with a separate index file for each
          calendar. (thanks Nate)

          file (miniconfig.php)

        * support for SQL servers besides MySQL (thanks phpBB)
        * Page to change options added

Version 0.7 (10/5/02):
        * added .php to end of .inc files
        * cleaned up the look a little,
        * modifying posts is fixed which may or may not have been broken in
          0.6
        * changed from specifying table name to table prefix.  to update
          you'll need to create the new table (ie phpc_events) then do an
          insert select to copy over the old data
        * not sure what is wrong with gettext.  It no longer works at all, but
          the _() function gets defined better.  basically, things are no
          longer giving errors, but they don't work anymore.

Version 0.6 (6/18/02):
        * LOTS of code clean-ups.
        * moved to xhtml

        * disallow remote access to config, header and footer files in apache
        * added an install script
        * removed $REMOTE_USER support, because I'll be adding my own
          eventually, and I never used or tested the current one.
        * added checking to mysql, reloading modify and add pages doesn't give
          the same entry many times.  deleting a non-existant item displays a
          failure
        * added an update script for version 0.3 and below

Version 0.4 (2/20/2002):
        * fix am/pm issues with new time input
        * add duration to events
        * add event type for full day and questionable times
        * not compatible with old databases

        * fix to make links work properly in IE
        * minor color tweak
        * bugfixes (thanks to richard datafordummies.com)
        * more fixes for Netscape 4
        * made time input more user-friendly and fixed bugs with the old
        method.
        * got rid of ugly old method of dealing with end dates and also found
        and squashed a bug relating to that

        * bug that caused header/title on pages besides index fixed
        * bug that caused modified elements to be added twice fixed
        * now regresses well in Netscape 4 (switches to HTML 4 transitional
        for old browsers)

Version 0.1 (02/11/2002):
        * moved to php4, if anyone finds a version of php4 that doesn't work,
          or finds this to work in a older version, please let me know
        * lots of style and HTML changes to try to make the calendar look more
        professional.  I've tried to make the style sheet somewhat friendly.
        If someone makes changes and wants a different style sheet included as
        well, send it to me.  this is all initial work and the changes are too
        many to include.  I decided to move to HTML 4.01/CSS2.  Only browsers
        which fully support these will display the calendar perfectly.  I
        tested using Mozilla, and that currently displays the calendar how I
        intended.  IE 5.5 and 6.0 don't support the CSS element
        border-spacing, so they look a little funny.  Netscape 4.x looks
        awful, but is still usable.
        * there was a bug where if you didn't include a subject, the post
          wouldn't show.
        * included timestamp on the table
        * added variables to change the displayed title and the header.
        * some code cleanups.
